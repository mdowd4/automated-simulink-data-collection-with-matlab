# automated-simulink-data-collection-with-matlab
This is a Matlab script that automates the process of simulating a Simulink model and recording output data. Rather than manually changing values in a Simulink model and determining output parameters each time by looking at a graph, this script loops through those model values and calculates the output parameters.
